======================= Data Mining ===========================================

Data mining, also called as data or knowledge discovery, means analyzing data from
 different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information – information 
 that can be used to take important decisions. And so we are discussing it in this
 Big Data Analytics tutorial. It is the technique of exploring, analyzing, and detecting
 patterns in large amounts of data. Goal of data mining is either data classification or
 data prediction. In classification, data is sorted into groups while in prediction, 
 value of a continuous variable is predicted.
 
In today’s world, data mining is been used in several sectors like Retail, sales 
analytics, Financial, Communication, Marketing Organizations etc. For example, a 
marketer may want to find who did and did not respond to a promotion. In prediction,
 the idea is to predict the value of a continuous (ie non-discrete) variable; for 
 example, a marketer may be interested in finding who will respond to a promotion.

Examples of Data Mining : 
    
    1. Classification of trees : 
       ======================== 
        These are Tree-shaped structures that represent sets of decisions.
    
    2. Logistic regression : 
       ===================== 
        It predicts the probability of an outcome that can only have two values.
    
    3. Neural networks : 
       ================= 
        These are non-linear predictive models that resemble biological neural 
        networks in structure and learn through training.
       
    4. Clustering techniques like the K-nearest neighbors : 
       ==================================================== 
        This is the technique that classifies each record in a dataset based on 
        a combination of the classes of the k record(s) most similar to it in a
        historical dataset (where k 1). Sometimes it is called the k-nearest 
        neighbor technique.
        
    5. Anomaly detection : 
       =================== 
        It is the identification of items, events or observations which do not 
        conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.
