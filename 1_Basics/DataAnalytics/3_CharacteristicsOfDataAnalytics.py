=============== Characteristics of Big Data Analysis ==========================

 1. Programmatic :
    ==============
    There might be need to write program for data analysis by using code to manipulate
    it or do any kind of exploration because of the scale of the data.
    
    
 2. Data Driven : 
    =============
    It means progress in an activity is compelled by data and program statements describe
    the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of
    steps to be taken. Many analysts use hypothesis driven approach to data analysis, Big
    Data can use the massive amount of data to drive the analysis.
    
 3. Attributes usage : 
    ==================
    For proper and accurate analysis of data, it can use lot of attributes. In the past,
    analysts dealt with hundreds of attributes or characteristics of the data source, 
    with Big Data there are now thousands of attributes and millions of observations.
    
 4. Iterative : 
    ===========
    As whole data is broken into samples and samples are then analyzed, data analytics
    can be iterative in nature. More compute power enables iteration of the models until
    Big Data analysts are satisfied. This has led to development of new applications 
    designed for addressing analysis requirements and time frames.
    
    
========= Any business problem can be analyzed for 2 issues: ==================

 1. Statistical Significance : 
    ==========================
    
    How problem is statistically important for decision making. Statistical significance
    testing takes some assumptions and determines the probability of happening of results
    if the assumptions are correct.
    
    
 2. Business Importance : 
    =====================
    
    It means how the problem is related with business and its importance. Always put
    the results in business context as part of the final validation process.
