#============= Big Data Analysis ==============================================

Data is information in raw format. With increasing data size, it has become need
 for inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of finding
 useful information, making conclusions, and supporting decision making. This 
 process is known as Big Data data analysis.
 
 
#============= Data Mining ====================================================

Data mining is a particular data analysis technique where modeling and knowledge
 discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes is focused. Business
 intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing on 
 business information. In statistical applications, some people divide business 
 analytics into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and 
 confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in 
 the data and CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive
 analytics does forecasting or classification by focusing on statistical or structural
 models while in text analytics, statistical, linguistic and structural techniques are
 applied to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured
 data. All are varieties of data analysis. 
 
 
#=========== Data analytics And Reporting =====================================

A reporting environment or a business intelligence (BI) environment involves calling
 and execution of reports. The outputs are then printed in the desired form. Reporting
 refers to the process of organizing and summarizing data in an easily readable format
 to communicate important information. Reports help organizations in monitoring 
 different areas of a performance and improving customer satisfaction.
 
>> reporting is the process of converting raw data into useful information.
>> Analysis transforms information into insights. 


============== Analysis vs Reporting ==========================================

>>Reporting provides data. A report will show the user what had happened in the past,
 to avoid inferences and help to get a feel of the data while analysis provides 
 answers for any question or issue.An analysis process takes any steps needed to
 get the answers to those questions.
 
>>Reporting just provides the data that is asked for while analysis provides the 
information or the answer that is actually needed.

>>Reporting is done in standardized manner while analysis can be customized. There
 are fixed standard formats for reporting while analysis is done as per the 
 requirement and it is customizable as needed.
 
>>Reporting can be done using a tool and it generally does not involve any person
 while in analysis, person is required who is doing analysis and who will lead 
 the process. He guides the complete analysis process.
 
>>Reporting is inflexible while analysis is flexible. Reporting provides no or limited
 context about whatâ€™s happening in the data and hence is inflexible while analysis 
 emphasizes data points that are significant, unique, or special, and it explains 
 why they are important to the business.
 
 ============= Steps involved in data analytics process =======================
 
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Data Evaluation
6. Deployment

>>  Business Understanding : Whenever any requirement occurs, firstly we need to 
                             determine business objective, assess the situation, 
                             determine data mining goals and then produce the project
                             plan as per the requirement. Business objectives are defined
                             in this phase.
                             
>>  Data Exploration : For further process, we need to gather initial data, describe
                       and explore the data and verify data quality to ensure it 
                       contains the data we require. Data collected from the various
                       sources is described in terms of its application and need for
                       the project in this phase. This is also known as data exploration.
                       This is necessary to verify the quality of data collected.
                       
>>  Data Preparation : From the data collected in last step, we need to select data as
                       per the need, clean it, construct it to get useful information 
                       and then integrate it all. Finally we need to format the data to
                       get appropriate data. Data is selected, cleaned, and integrated
                       in the format finalized for the analysis in this phase.
                       
>> Data Modeling : Once data is gathered, we need to do data modeling. For this, we
                   need to select modeling technique, generate test design, build 
                   model and assess the model built. Data model is build to analyze
                   relationships between various selected objects in the data, test
                   cases are built for assessing the model and model is tested and 
                   implemented on the data in this phase.
                    
>> Data Evaluation : Next come data evaluation where we evaluate the results generated
                     in last step, review the scope of error and determine next steps
                     that need to be performed. Results of the test cases are evaluated
                     and reviewed for the scope of error in this phase.
                     
>> Deployment : Final step in analytic process is deployment. Here we need to plan the
                deployment and monitoring and maintenance, we need to produce final
                report and review the project. Results of the analysis are deployed 
                in this phase. This is also known as reviewing of the project.
